# RestHelloWorld

This is a .NET 6 MVC API application that implements nothing more than Hello World GET requests. Swagger docs & Swagger UI is a part of this.

This application is meant to be reused for quick proof-of-concept scenarios and is intended to be configurable in some unique ways.

Specifically, I plan to hook this Github repo to Azure Deployments to feed proof-of-concept applications hosted in Azure App Services.
